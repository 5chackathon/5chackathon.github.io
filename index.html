    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <div class="overview_desc" style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
      <p>
        The <span class="bold-blue">5C Hackathon</span> is a student-run 24-hour event held at Pomona College. Historically, hundreds of Claremont College students gather to work on a diverse range of projects.
        Our hackathon is a highly anticipated and attended tradition at the Claremont Colleges, drawing creative minds from all five schools in the liberal arts consortium: <span class="bold-blue">Pomona</span>, <span class="bold-blue">Harvey Mudd</span>, <span class="bold-blue">Claremont McKenna</span>, <span class="bold-blue">Scripps</span>, and <span class="bold-blue">Pitzer</span>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="no-margin-top dark-blue">What makes the 5C Hackathon different?</h2>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm">
          <h4>Inclusivity</h4>
          <p class="">
            We pride ourselves on building a creative and diverse techical community and in making the 5C Hackathon <span class="bold-blue">beginner-friendly and inclusive</span>. At our last event, more than 50% of  participants were first-time hackers, and more than 50% identified as non-male. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm">
          <h4>Individual Development</h4>
          <p class="">
            <span class="bold-blue">Teaching and mentorship</span> are of the utmost importance. We teach <span class="bold-blue">beginner and advanced workshops </span> throughout the week preceding the hackathon, an event we lovingly call <a href="#hack-week" class = "link">Hack Week</a>. We have mentors available throughout the event as well.

      <h2 class="no-margin-top dark-blue">Theme, Tracks, & Overlays</h2>
      <h4>Theme</h4>
      <!-- <p>The overarching theme is <b>Tech for Good</b>. <b>Good</b> entails many things. <b>Good</b> means helping people, animals, organizations, or the environment positively. <b>Good</b> can be big: serving entire populations with disabilities, in minority status, or who have been disenfranchised, for example. It can also be small: assisting a local COVID testing site, connecting people to their local voting station, or stopping the spread of a locally invasive plant. The sky is the limit, but in any case, it is always for the GREATER <b>Good</b> rather than personal gain. </p> -->
      <p>The overarching theme is <b>Tech for Good</b>! <b>Good</b> means helping people, animals, organizations, or the environment positively. <b>Good</b> can be big, serving entire populations, and it can be small, impacting local or niche topics. In any case, it is always for the greater <b>Good</b> rather than personal gain. </p>

      <p>Prizes will be awarded to the top team in each track and the top team in each overlay that creates a great project while demonstrating the spirit of <b>Tech for Good</b>.

      <!-- <p>Aside from the Top 3 spots, there are additional prizes attached to the below tracks. Note: teams may enter into both tracks, but can not win more than one track. You also do not have to enter these tracks, and can do something completely different!
